Our research endeavors to explain the biological mechanisms underlying persistent childhood undernutrition, impacting more than 150 million children globally. Our focus is on understanding environmental enteropathy (EE), a pathophysiology of the small intestine. EE hinders nutrient absorption and is highly prevalent in regions with high rates of enteropathogens and childhood undernutrition. The aberrant inflammation present in EE may be an evolved response to prevent gut microbial translocation and acute infection in settings of high pathogen exposure. This inflammation results in chronic undernutrition during the critical developmental period of early childhood. My lab aims to identify the key factors driving the unresolved inflammatory processes in EE, with the ultimate goal of developing targeted interventions to enhance growth and developmental outcomes for children in low-resource settings. We approach these questions from several angles, as described below.

## Assessing the role of the developing gut microbiota in chronic childhood undernutrition 

## Evaluating immune function within the small intestine in pregnant women at high risk of environmental enteropathy
